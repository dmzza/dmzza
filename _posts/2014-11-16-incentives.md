My goal is to make one dollar in profit by the end of the 2014. Note that I don't count my time as an expense. I also don't think of normal costs of doing business like the Apple Developer annual fee as an expense, because it is necessary to be in my line of work at all. An expense would be something like running ads or paying for a server specifically for a side project.

Tune Out looks like the best candidate to achieve this goal with. It has a super-niche market to start with, but I can address any market generally, and then launch in a specific market if there is demand. It has a monopoly in this market as far as I know. There is no other app that will tell you exactly when to wake up for your stop on the L train in New York City. Likewise for BART if and when I launch in San Francisco.

Initially Tune Out was a paid app for $0.99, but it only sold a handful of times while I was paying for ads. Further research indicated that the cost-per-install is too high now compared to the lifetime-value of a customer in a paid app to justify advertising as a method of customer acquisition. Instead, I'm going to start blogging about it, with this as the first entry.

I want to align the my incentives to improve the product for customers with the way that it generates revenue. The incentives for a paid up-front app are to create really great screenshots and an app with a solid set of features so that people might recommend it to friends. But there is less incentive to add new features later. Advertising works well because I make money when users open the app. I am incentivized to do anything that will make it easier an more compelling to form a habit of using it. The advertisements aren't distracting from a task either, because the only task is setting the alarm, which is only 2-3 steps. An ad for a game would fit perfectly after you just settled into your commute. If I solve a painful problem for someone, Tune Out will become indispensable for that person until a competitor arrives.
