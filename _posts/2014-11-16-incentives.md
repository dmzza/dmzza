Why do I want to solve a problem for mass transit commuters?

I want to design apps to solve the problems that the average person encounters every day in cities. I want to make something that somebody will remember me for because I made their day easier, more productive or less boring. Architects design buildings for other people to enjoy, admire and use. I design apps for the ideals. Architects get paid for the type of work that they are capable of. Some are draftsman, while others have their own practice. Right now I’m a draftsman, but I want my own practice some day. If I ever get there, it will be by solving problems that make my day easier and not so serious. 

I could imagine an interface with live transit info that lets you pick the moving bus that you boarded and set the spot where you want to get off. Just by picking that bus, it can tell you all kinds of neat info about what is going on. How close to the schedule the bus is, how long it usually takes, how long the previous bus took to travel your distance, how many times you have caught the same bus. By setting where you want to get off, it can remind you to pull the cord so that you don’t have to look out the window. You could even put a virtual friend on another line and see who reaches your destination first.

The problem is that I haven’t found anybody clamoring for my app. In a year of being on the app store, not a single person has contacted me asking when it would be available for more trains or more cities. One person left a poor review because it only works on the L train. Maybe most people skip it once they realize that it is only a prototype. After thinking so long about it, I’m going to pursue it anyway. At least I will use it.  I’ve never wanted to pursue something so badly that I perceived to have so little potential. Because the market size is anybody in any city in the world, it feels like a huge mountain to climb to reach any of them. The best niche I can think of that I am a part of is transit nerds. 

Transit nerds are like gurus to their friends. They know all the weird historical details of the city’s system, and they know all the hacks and shortcuts for getting around. To most people, a transit system is humorously nonsensical and convoluted, but to a transit nerd it is a rich history of politicking and funding shortages and changes in fashion and public will for capital projects. The transit nerds could be my best hope for gaining a reputation as a thoughtful software designer. There is just no reason to keep denying that I am one.
