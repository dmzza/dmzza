My plan for the next five years is very similar to many 20-somethings in the Bay Area. I’m looking for a full time position now so that by 30, I won’t be a junior engineer anymore. What happens in between is less clear. The only certain thing is that I will be in a very different position.

My goal for 2015 is only to be a sponge. I don’t need to start a company or lead a team or release a product. I just want to learn as much as possible. But being a sponge isn’t a measurable objective. The objective is to use what I’ve learned to earn a new job title by 2016.

Instead of wanting to be right, I want to be honest, rational and to learn from other people’s mistakes. Protecting an ego creates politics and inhibits collaboration and growth. The mind that is never wrong is a stagnating mind. Likewise, I’d expect to find a company culture with the same values. If I find that the team I join is driven primarily by egos, I would search for another team. I am investing in a career, not betting on ideas.

By 2016, I still want to be surrounded by people that I can learn from, but I also want to teach what I’ve learned. That might be what this blog is for. I didn’t include a monetary goal here. Money is only a measuring stick for value. The most direct way to create value in a career is to learn, grow and teach. By focusing on that, the money problem solves itself.

Projecting specifics for 2017-2020 is less useful. Right now I’m starting as a Rails Front-End Engineer, but I could easily become a Full-Stack, iOS or Ruby Engineer. Maybe I’ll be one of the first Senior Swift Engineers. By 2020 I hope to be more well established in a vertical so that I can switch to a new one more easily when I want to.

In terms of personal goals, I hope to travel more. Traveling for a job would be great. I’ve only been out of the US once. It would be great to see Copenhagen, Tokyo, São Paulo, Similan Islands, etc. I would also love to be making some money on one of Apple’s platforms. Like traveling, this is an emotional desire, but it is also a great way to learn. I also want to read more books each year outside of my comfort zone.

After 2020, the next five year plan might include a business or a family. With any luck, I might already have one of those by 2020. I will evaluate this plan once a year to check my progress and amend it as necessary. But of course, all planning is guessing and projecting five years out is mostly bullshit. I can’t take it too seriously. What I really want in 2020 is a car that drives itself to a lawless experimental society on Mars and an iPhone 12 or an Apple implantable.
