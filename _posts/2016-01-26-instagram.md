# Three simple features that are responsible for Instagram’s success

In 2012, before Instagram had any way of making money, Facebook purchased it for $1 billion. Instagram is arguably the most successful social network since Facebook itself. Facebook needed Instagram because it was the most popular place to share photos taken with the most popular camera in the world; the iPhone.

Instagram’s filters and frames made it easy for anyone to take more expressive snapshots with the iPhone. Every photo you take is instantly published on your user profile and fed to anyone who follows you.

## User Profiles
Your journey with Instagram starts with a super simple profile. All that’s required, is a photo, username and a description to complete your account. The majority of space on your profile is consumed by your gallery of Instagram photos.

## Feed
We came for the filters, but we stay for the feed.
Most users will spend far more time browsing their feed than posting new photos. They have stuck with a simple feed design that isn’t far from what you might build in a prototype. One photo at a time scrolling down in reverse-chronological order. (+hearts)

## Taking a Photo
There are hundreds of apps that will filter and frame your photos, but Instagram made a subtle tweak to compel even timid users to share every photo to the feed. Whether you use it as a camera or an editor, the result isn’t saved to your device until you publish it on your profile.

I don’t just admire great success stories, I had the opportunity to take charge of Apple’s App of the Year, Elevate Brain Training. Which entails scoping, ideation and building the first prototype of the app.

# Instagram in 30 days
If the founder of Instagram had come to me with a thirty day budget to build the first version of Instagram, I would have started by focusing on those three critical features. 
—
Filtering & Framing Photos, storing them in the cloud
> 5-7 days

—
Creating and Following User Profiles

The quality of the sign up process determines what percentage of people will actually begin using the app, so it is a crucial part to spend time on. 
> 10-15 days

—

The Feed, Hearts and Comments
> 3-5 Days


### Budget
Assuming another 3-5 days spent going back and forth with design ideas for critical pieces of the interface, the first working version could be shipped in less than 30 days, which works out to $15k.
