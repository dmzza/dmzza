In 2012, before Instagram had any way of making money, Facebook purchased it for $1 billion. Facebook needed Instagram because it was the most popular place to share photos taken with the most popular camera in the world; the iPhone. Instagram is arguably the most successful social network since Facebook itself.

Achieving the scale of Instagram at their rate of growth is almost unprecedented, but building the app that led to that outcome is relatively easy if you identify the core features to focus on and ignore everything else.

Instagram’s filters and frames made it easy for anyone to take more expressive snapshots with the iPhone. Every photo you take is instantly published on your user profile and fed to anyone who follows you.

### User Profiles
Your journey with Instagram starts with a super simple profile. All that’s required is a photo, username and a description to complete your account. The majority of space on your profile is consumed by your gallery of Instagram photos.

### Feed
Most users will spend far more time browsing their feed than posting new photos. They came for the filters but stayed for the feed. Instagram has stuck with a simple feed design that isn’t far from what you might build in a prototype. One photo at a time scrolling down in reverse-chronological order.

Hearts are an effortless way to appreciate people you follow. It gives people a reason to come back to their profile to see how many hearts each photo received. This virtuous cycle keeps people coming back to Instagram once they have a network of friends and interesting characters to keep up with.

### Taking a Photo
There are hundreds of apps that will filter and frame your photo, but Instagram compelled even timid users to share every photo to the feed with a subtle tweak: whether you use it as a camera or an editor, the result isn’t saved to your device until you publish it onto your profile.

## Instagram in 30 days
If the founder of Instagram had come to me with a thirty-day budget to build the first version of Instagram, I would have started by focusing on those three critical features.

### 10-15 days
Signing up for an app collects your email address, but more importantly, this is where new users will form opinions about the app, so it is a crucial part to spend time on. New users learn how to enhance and publish a photo, but are also inspired to travel and take amazing photos.

### 5-7 days
The second thing the user tries is filtering and framing a photo. The interface for this is easy to imagine, and not difficult to build. When you’re ready to publish the photo, it needs to be uploaded to the cloud. [insert progress bar gif] Anything that takes time in the app needs to look busy rather than frozen.

### 3-5 days
The feed will keep users around, but it can also be very modest at first. I would only build a vertical list of photos that can be seen one at a time. This interface can be used both for the feed and profile tabs.

### Budget
Leaving room for some days spent going back and forth with design ideas for critical pieces of the interface, the first working version could be shipped in about 30 days, which works out to $15k. If you’re looking for someone to build the first version of your idea, shoot me an email.
