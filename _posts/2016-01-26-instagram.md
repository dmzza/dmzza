# What does it take to start building Instagram?

Instagram is one of the most popular apps in the world, but it’s always been known for simplicity. They have said no to so many ideas in order to focus on the important stuff. To this day, they still don’t have an iPad app.
The most important stuff can be reduced to a few basic components. Instagram would be nothing without the ability to take a photo. The original and lasting value of Instagram are their easy filters that enable anybody to take professional-looking snapshots. But it isn’t enough just to take a great photo, every photo you take is instantly published on your user profile. Like almost any app with user profiles, you can connect with other users by following them. This populates the most important tab in the app, the feed. 

## Taking a Photo
Almost every photo app gets photos either directly from the camera or from photo albums. The iPhone makes it easy to built this feature in the simplest way. Once you have a photo, Instagram uploads it to their website for anyone to see. 

## User Profiles
Everyone’s first experience with Instagram includes creating a user profile when they sign up. Instagram makes it simple. You just need a photo, username and a description to complete your profile. The majority of space on your profile is consumed by your gallery of Instagram photos. 

## Feed
Most users will spend far more time browsing their feed than posting new photos. Everybody came for the filters, but we stay for the feed. They have stuck with a feed design that isn’t far from what you might build in a prototype of Instagram. One photo at a time scrolling down in reverse-chronological order. 

# How long would it take to build the first version of an app like Instagram?
If I were building Instagram, I would start by focusing on those three critical features. I would start very simply by using the built-in interface for taking or importing photos. I would build the server software to store photos, user profiles, and to compile each user’s feed. This could be done in 5-7 days. Next I would focus on a simple way for users to sign up and create a user profile. Between design and development, this would take about 10-15 days. The quality of the sign up process determines what percentage of people will actually begin using the app, so it is a crucial part to spend time on. Finally, I would link the server and the app and load the feed of photos on the primary screen of the app when it first opens.
