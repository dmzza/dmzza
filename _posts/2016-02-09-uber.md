Uber wants to build a self driving car, but they didn't start by competing with Google Maps or inventing AI, they started by driving people around. Once cars can drive themselves, it will be faster and cheaper to have one pick you up and drop you off than to own and park your own car. In that world, the absolutely necessary component is a network of riders that go everywhere with the app instead of their own car. Uber began as everyone's private driver. Today they partner with drivers, eventually they will only need cars. 

Any on-demand app shouldn't start by copying Uber, it should start with only what is absolutely necessary, and nothing more.

1. An app for customers.
If your customers expect something fast, an app is a great way to request it.

2. Text your partners.
Your drivers get paid, so they don't need to be catered to at first. Why build an app where a text can do just as well.

3. 3rd party payment.
Let someone else collect credit cards and handle payment technology.
