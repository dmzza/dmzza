Nobody defeats a giant by deciding one day to become a giant. Great software starts small and excels at solving a problem that other companies are ignoring.

Google has been researching and prototyping self-driving cars for over a decade now. Other tech giants Tesla and Apple are racing to produce the first self-driving car. In 2010 a little private car service named Uber was [launched by two guys](https://newsroom.uber.com/5-years-travis-kalanick/) who "wanted to push a button and get a ride." It was obvious at the time to use black-cars and drivers to do it. Uber's growth strategy has remained consistent since their scrappy startup days: they offered a fast and more reliable service that customers trusted and they leveraged their popular support to fight antiquated regulations. In five years, Uber has become the verb for getting a ride somewhere.

Even though Google is years ahead on the technology for a self driving car, they don't have the lobbying infrastructure necessary to change regulations or a brand that people trust to take them places. Über is betting that their business will be harder to replicate than Google's technology.

Now Uber is the only company that is well suited for a world where most people no longer own cars, because they don’t sell cars, they sell rides. Uber started out with very little technology, and certainly no car technology. They didn’t even start building driving directions until more recently. They leveraged the iPhone and the demand for cabs that was already there.
Uber's success has helped create an on-demand economy in major cities. New startups can tap into the labor pool created by über, but it is worth asking if there is room for a wide array of services like über but with less demand. 10 minute meal delivery startups like munchery already face competition from Über Eats, and even Google's same-day delivery service faces competition from Über Rush. Just like internet services back in the 2000's that were asked what they would do if Google did it for free, now every on-demand service should ask what they would do if Über offered it.

Über' success has created a whole mini industry of on-demand services powered by mobile apps, especially here in San Francisco. Many of these companies can piggy-back on Uber's drivers because they don't always have a steady flow of rides. But for many drivers, über remains their main source of revenue, so it would be easy for über to expand the types of services their drivers can provide, effectively shutting out o

Finally, Über devised a great model for paying drivers that they are now defending in court. Instead of owning cars and employing drivers, they just connect independent drivers with riders. Not all on-demand services can attract enough workers to remain available quickly and consistently without a steady flow of requests like Über has. Some have resorted to paying workers a salary, which is an enormous waste without enough customers to keep them busy. Unless you want to be acquired by über, you'll have to find a clever way to attract workers, or operate a very high-margin business that has more room to keep workers on the payroll. If all of Uber's customers are the ideal target market for your service, there is a decent chance über will be able to offer it faster and cheaper eventually.
