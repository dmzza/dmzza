Uber wants to build a self driving car, but they didn't start by competing with Google Maps or inventing AI, they started by driving people around. Once cars can drive themselves, it will be faster and cheaper to have one pick you up and drop you off than to own and park your own car. In that world, the absolutely necessary component is a network of riders that go everywhere with the app instead of their own car. Uber began as everyone's private driver. Today they partner with drivers, eventually they will only need cars. 

A new entrant in the on-demand service market shouldn't start by copying Uber, they should only build what is necessary to generate demand for the service. An app that connects service providers with customers needs to build a two-sided network. Building any network is hard, but building two networks at once that depend each other is even harder. Think about what each side wants: customers want easy and reliable access to the service, providers want a regular supply of work.

### An app for customers
If customers expect something fast, an app is a great way to request it. Nobody wants to spend any more time in your app than they have to. Make signing up and requesting the service as easy as possible. For example, why ask for a password when a phone number is just as easy use for verification? Getting an Uber just requires a phone number and current location. After they make their first request, ask for credit card details while they wait. No fancy features needed at first either. A live ETA on a map is nice to have, but it doesn’t make the car arrive any faster. 

### Nothing but texts for providers
Building an app for providers won’t increase their supply of work, so why build an app when sending a text for each job can do just as well. This doesn’t even need to be automated at first. If you only have a few providers, have somebody send a text out for each request.

### Integration with payment tech
Let someone else collect credit cards and handle payment technology. Stripe or Braintree is great at this. Maybe giving Square readers to your providers makes more sense. Do whatever is easier at first and move on. Success or failure in gaining traction will have almost nothing to do with the way you collect credit cards, unless you make it difficult for customers.
