Uber wants to build a self driving car, but they don't start by competing with google maps or with AI, they start by driving people around.

Any on-demand app shouldn't start by copying Uber, it should start with only what is absolutely necessary, and nothing more.

1. An app for customers.
If your customers expect something fast, an app is a great way to request it.

2. Text your partners.
Your drivers get paid, so they don't need to be catered to at first. Why build an app where a text can do just as well.

3. 3rd party payment.
Let someone else collect credit cards and handle payment technology.
