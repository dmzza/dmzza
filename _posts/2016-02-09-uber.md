Uber wants to build a self driving car, but they didn't start by competing with Google Maps or inventing AI, they started by driving people around. Once cars can drive themselves, it will be faster and cheaper to have one pick you up and drop you off than to own and park your own car. In that world, the absolutely necessary component is a network of riders that go everywhere with the app instead of their own car. Uber began as everyone's private driver. Today they partner with drivers, eventually they will only need cars. 

A new entrant in the on-demand service market shouldn't start by copying Uber, they should only build what is necessary to generate demand for the service. An app that connects service providers with customers needs to build a two-sided network. Building any network is hard, but building two networks at once that depend each other is even harder. Think about what each side wants: customers want easy and and reliable access to the service, providers want a regular supply of work.

1. An app for customers.
If your customers expect something fast, an app is a great way to request it.

2. Text your providers.
Building an app for providers wonâ€™t increase their supply of work, so why build an app when sending a text for each job can do just as well.

3. 3rd party payment.
Let someone else collect credit cards and handle payment technology.
