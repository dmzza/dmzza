Nobody defeats a giant by deciding one day to become a giant. Great software starts small and excels at solving a problem that other companies are ignoring.

Google has been researching and prototyping self-driving cars for over a decade now. Other tech giants Tesla and Apple are in a recruiting war to revolutionize the auto industry. In 2010 a little private car service named Uber was [launched by two guys](https://newsroom.uber.com/5-years-travis-kalanick/) who "wanted to push a button and get a ride." It was obvious at the time to use black-cars and drivers to do it. Uber's growth strategy has remained consistent since their scrappy startup days: they offered a fast and more reliable service that customers trusted and they leveraged their popular support to fight antiquated regulations. In five years, Uber has become the verb for getting a ride somewhere.

## Uber's Business

Now Uber is the only company that is well suited for a world where most people will pay for rides instead of owning cars. Even though Google is years ahead on the technology for a self-driving car, they don't have a brand that people think of to get a ride. Uber is betting that their business will be harder to replicate than Google's technology.

Uber's success has helped create an on-demand economy in major cities. Although newer entrants can tap into the established labor pool of Uber drivers, it isn't clear that there is room for a wide array of services with less frequent demand or smaller demographics. 10-minute meal delivery startups like Munchery already face competition from Uber Eats and Google's same-day shopping delivery service faces competition from Uber Rush. Web services used to worry that Google might offer something similar for free, so for the same reason, on-demand services should worry that Uber might come in at a lower price with a larger network. If the only qualification to deliver your service is a driver's license, there is a decent chance Uber will be able to offer it faster and cheaper eventually.

## Driverless Rides

Google might be the first company to build technology that is consistently safer than human drivers and Tesla could be the first to sell a fully autonomous vehicle to the mass-market. Apple may be the first to fully integrated a car with the App Store. But while they are figuring out how to sell fancy cars to a slowly shrinking number of buyers, Uber will still be giving rides to people, meals, shopping bags and packages around the world.

Maybe some of those rides won't need a human driver anymore. Eventually, none of them will. Uber can already [cut the cost](https://stratechery.com/2015/uber-2-0-human-self-driving-cars/) of [the driver](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/uber-is-testing-ubercommute-a-new-carpooling-service-in-china/) today with [UberCommute](https://newsroom.uber.com/ubercommute/). The future has a way of sneaking up.
