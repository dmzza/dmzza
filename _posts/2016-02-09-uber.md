Nobody defeats a giant by deciding one day to become a giant. Great software starts small and excels at solving a problem that other companies are ignoring.

Google has been researching and prototyping self-driving cars for over a decade now. Other tech giants Tesla and Apple are racing to produce the first self-driving car. In 2010 a little private car service named Uber was [launched by two guys](https://newsroom.uber.com/5-years-travis-kalanick/) who "wanted to push a button and get a ride." It was obvious at the time to use black-cars and drivers to do it. Uber's growth strategy has remained consistent since their scrappy startup days: they offered a fast and more reliable service that customers trusted and they leveraged their popular support to fight antiquated regulations. In five years, Uber has become the verb for getting a ride somewhere.

Now Uber is the only company that is well suited for a world where most people will no longer own cars, because Uber sells rides. Even though Google is years ahead on the technology for a self driving car, they don't have a brand that people think of to get a ride. Uber is betting that their business will be harder to replicate than Google's technology.

Uber's success has helped create an on-demand economy in major cities. Although newer entrants can tap into the established labor pool of Uber drivers, it isn't clear that there is room for a wide array of services with less frequent demand or smaller demographics. 10 minute meal delivery startups like Munchery already face competition from Uber Eats and Google's same-day shopping delivery service faces competition from Uber Rush. Web services used to worry that Google might offer something similar for free, so for the same reason, on-demand services should worry that Uber might come in at a lower price with a larger network. If Uber's average customer is the ideal target market for your service, there is a decent chance Uber will be able to offer it faster and cheaper eventually.

Über' success has created a whole mini industry of on-demand services powered by mobile apps, especially here in San Francisco. Many of these companies can piggy-back on Uber's drivers because they don't always have a steady flow of rides. But for many drivers, über remains their main source of revenue, so it would be easy for über to expand the types of services their drivers can provide, effectively shutting out o
