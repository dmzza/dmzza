I totally buy into [Ben Thompson’s assertion](http://stratechery.com/2014/now-apple-watch/) that the biggest competitor to the Apple Watch will be the iPhone. In order to cannibalize the iPhone, new input methods that are uniquely suited for the Apple Watch will be critical. The iPhone has always been large enough to rely on a traditional qwerty keyboard with some smarts like auto-correct and dynamically resized touch targets for certain keys. Although you could use the same strategies on a watch screen, using half of the screen for a keyboard is a lot to give up.

Apple has already introduced more input methods on the Watch than they ever had on the iPhone. Now we will be sending doodles, heartbeats, taps, short-replies and voice messages. Their only input method for arbitrary text is voice recognition. While they must see the need for real text input, they haven't yet proposed a replacement for the keyboard. This is a huge sandbox for third party developers to play in.

Two keyboards for iOS 8 have developed a typing recognition method that can be used without tapping a screen. [Fleksy](http://fleksy.com) and [Minuum](http://minuum.com) have both [made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gMWa_GtGho) [demonstrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEy9jxwte4) on [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com). They also [offer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvcUyJ7KrFU) [keyboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6ey1SzHdM) for the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch. Fleksy can recognize typing from the blind so that accuracy and touch targets are almost irrelevant. Minuum can recognize typing in one dimension so it takes very little space. They both retain the QWERTY layout for English and Fleksy supports forty other languages. These seem like the most promising solutions for power users of a watch.

Minuum works pretty well in miniature or "1 dimensional" mode. I’m typing this paragraph in miniature mode mode just to prove the point to myself. The only problem I have is with autocorrect because it happens in real time with each letter typed. In spite of that I think it has potential in a watch.

Most other keyboards aren’t a huge departure from the standard iOS keyboard. SwiftKey and Swype add swipe typing, but it still takes a lot of space and I’ve never liked the concept. It precludes the idea of using gestures for common actions like space or delete. I'm already hooked on those gestures in Fleksy and Minuum after two weeks.

It could be very easy and attractive to type without a keyboard-like interface. Fleksy offers an invisible keyboard (on Android) and Minuum can work with just a dial like the digital crown. Both sound like a decent middle ground between a full onscreen keyboard and short-replies.

> The way that we treated this from a design point of view wasn't that you had hardware and then software, our experience as users, as customer is that they're one in the same. ...We designed the user interface [to give] people multiple choices in terms of just watch faces.

Paying to customize your watch will go far beyond watch faces and bands. Jony Ive sees the hardware and software as the same thing from the wearer's perspective, creating millions of possible combinations. If this really becomes a standalone device, finding most attractive, subtle or efficient input methods will be even more valuable than the best messaging apps. Somebody is going to make the candy crush of input methods for watches. The Apple Watch is the first computing device with pricing tiers only for the materials rather than specs. Because the Apple Watch is more of a status symbol than a commodity device, it create a new high-end software market for personalizing everything that is prominently visible about it. Jewelry software is coming.
