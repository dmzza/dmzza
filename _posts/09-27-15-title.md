Titling a blog post before writing it.

Working a full time job is not what I’ve always dreamed of doing. But the opportunity to work in the role that I now have is more than I ever could have asked for. On screen, I am a Software Engineer in the Engineering Department. Our company of 14 also has a Marketing Department of one, a Product Division of nebulous size, and Operations, as evidenced by the Co-Founder’s title of COO. 

The truth is that I would like to be that Co-Founder, or the Product Division, or the man who comes up with such titles, departments divisions and so forth. None of these divisions or titles mean anything in the office, but nonetheless, somebody had to type them out in the HR software just to provide some sense of clarity in the blob that is a young software company.

The problem with giving this post a title before I write it is the same problem as summarizing the future before it’s happened. I may wish now that the future would be different, but it is not like there is some standard or inevitable path that I might avoid if I wanted it to be different. So whether I title this post: “Why a full time job is an investment in the future” or “Why dropping everything and starting a company is a grand idea” it is pure speculation. Neither title means anything until it has happened, and then I could say “well I tried that and here is what happened”

So, I tried contracting and building my own apps. Now I have a great job. So, it was a great idea to do all that contracting and to learn enough to build my own iOS apps so that now I have this job. If you want my job, that is one way to get it.

“Why you shouldn’t get a full time job right out of college, but instead do a lot of programming and design on your own for two years, and then get a job”

Yes, I think that will do, but it is too long. So I will stick with the title that I made before I wrote this.
