I am debating about how to scale Tune Out beyond one subway line in New York City. I can either generalize the subway problem, or shift focus above ground lines where I can use GPS.

If I shift focus, I will probably create a new app temporarily to a different problem in a way that will not be useful on the L train. It is a safe bet that I can pull it off, but that poses the risk of being boring. If I solve the harder problem of combining the sensor data available without a signal, I may sink a lot of time into it or fail, and it could even work against my initial business idea of [serving ads]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-10-25-tuning-out %}).
