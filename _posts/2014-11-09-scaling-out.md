>> Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

I am debating about how to scale Tune Out beyond one subway line in New York City. I can generalize the subway problem or shift focus above ground lines where GPS and live route information is available.

If I shift focus, I will probably create a new app because it won't work underground anymore. It is a safe bet that I can pull it off, but that poses the risk of being boring. If I solve the harder problem of combining the sensor data available without a signal, I may sink a lot of time into it or fail, and it could even work against my initial business idea of [serving ads]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-10-26-tuning-out %}).
