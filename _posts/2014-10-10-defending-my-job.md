I've spent the last two weeks mentally defending the company that I've chosen to work for. The posts that I write here reflect and formalize my thoughts. This week I began to question whether or not it was a good idea to feel bullish about the product that I'm employed full time to work on.

A large portion of the reason that I've written about the Apple Watch and mobile keyboards is because I want to feel bullish about the things that I'm working on. There isn't a good reason to feel pessimistic unless I were going to quit. But there also isn't a compelling reason to feel bullish either. If the company can create value that is two orders of magnitude greater than the initial investments, I do stand to benefit, but not in a life changing way. I'm not a particularly early employee, nor a very experienced one. My potential share of the company will be very modest if I choose to purchase it.

Although I did find out roughly what my share of the company would be, it isn't and shouldn't be very important. The most likely outcome is that the value of the company will never reach an order of magnitude greater than what was put into it. The team itself has some value and the technology might be useful to an phone manufacturer, but it needs to become the next Line or WhatsApp, and there are very few of those.

It is really interesting to experience the current stage of the company while it is trying to become the first keyboard on iOS that is more accurate than the iOS keyboard.

I have a habit of placing a lot of importance on outcomes the products that I work on for a living. Nobody hopes for failure, but I am overly optimistic about the potential for success of the people who pay me. I'm also really optimistic that I could carry their success on my shoulders, when I haven't even had personal success building a product yet. 1
