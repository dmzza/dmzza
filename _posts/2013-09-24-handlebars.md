Bike sharing in NYC launched with a lot of problems, but the one that bothered me the most was a mysterious software problem. Their live reporting of available bikes and docks was wildly unpredictable.

### Goals
I realized that the number of bikes or docks didn't matter as much as the binary prediction of availability when I get there. There could be 10 bikes available in front of Penn Station, but if they are running out quickly, I would rather walk farther for a better chance of getting a bike.

I designed a heads-up map so that you just have to walk towards the highlighted pin. Transforming an Apple Map into a rotating circle centered on the bottom of the screen was one of the most challenging parts to implement.

### Role
This was the second iPhone app that I designed and developed in Objective C. I made the app to scratch my own itch for a better bike sharing app. I also designed the icons for bikes and spaces.
