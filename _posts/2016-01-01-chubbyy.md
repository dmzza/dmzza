This is the screen in [Shot Rocket]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-07-16-shot-rocket-icon %}) for sorting a photo.

### Goals
I want to make quick impulsive decisions when I am looking through photos. The primary task is to find the best photos. Blurry photos are easy to archive, and photos that don't stand out can be skipped. The process continues indefinitely so that I can see each photo multiple times, with the group getting smaller as I archive the uninteresting photos.

After a few passes, the best photos will float to the top of the group.

### Role
I designed the app and [icon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-07-16-shot-rocket-icon %}) in Sketch and I am writing the app in Objective C. I briefly began rewriting the app in Swift during the summer, but I stopped once I realized how rapidly Swift's syntax was changing.
