The [Clarion Music Society](http://clarionsociety.org) is New York City's period-instrument orchestra founded in 1957. They sell tickets to their events online, as well as an annual benefit.

### Role
I am the designer for the Society, responsible for designing their website, email, print and photography. I created the website in HTML and CSS with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

### Goals
In redesigning the site, I wanted to increase the ratio of photos to text and make the events more prominent. The home page is almost completely stripped of text and almost every image links to ticket sales. Each event has its own page that can be archived after the season passes.

The Orchestra Series subscription was always a bit confusing to me. To make it easier, the subscription call-to-action only appears on event pages that are included in the series, and the Subscribe button is highlighted on the top of those pages.
