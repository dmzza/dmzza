I have two road bikes, one for myself, and another in case a friend wants to
ride with me. I see a lot of bikes with the sticker "one less car" which never
applied to me. It assumes that the rider would otherwise require a car to get
where she needs to go. The reason I ride a bike is because it is more enjoyable
than driving. The human body and brain is well suited for biking. Whenever I'm
forced to drive a car in the city, I envy the bikers passing me and blowing reds.
For me, riding a bike has nothing to do with saving the environment
or reducing congestion. It is entirely a selfish desire. If riding a bike had
an even worse environmental impact than driving a car, I would still do it.

Humans are not well suited for driving a car when other cars are around. That's
why I dislike driving a car and why it is so deadly. I'm not afraid of an
accident, I'm just annoyed that it is even possible. From a user experience
perspective, driving a car in traffic is miserable. Worse
yet, that miserable and frustrating human experience is usually the cause of
traffic in the first place.

Computers are far more well suited to drive amongst other human drivers and even
more well suited to drive amongst only other autonomous cars. In the best case
scenario, cars would cooperate in both a distributed and centralized way.
Distributed in the sense that each car would be responsible for its own safety,
but it could communicate information to nearby cars that humans could never
communicate. Centralized systems already exist like traffic reporting, Uber for
ride sharing and Google Maps for dynamic routing based on conditions.

I refuse to buy a car until I can afford one that is at least partially
autonomous. If I'm going to sink six months of salary into a device that carries
me around, the last thing I want is to be responsible for driving it all the
time. I'll only take over driving on the open road for fun and speed.

I hope that in my lifetime, human driving will be banned in cities. If I wait
long enough, there probably won't be any practical reason to buy a car. The cost
of commuting in a driverless Uber could drop below the cost of owning or leasing
a car.
