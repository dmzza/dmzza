Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

### Goals
This is a mockup for a future version of the app. Estimated arrival times for approaching trains make it easy to visualize how much time you have to catch the next train.

### Role
I designed, implemented and released the initial version in 2013. Designed on paper and in Xcode, and written in Objective C. This mockup was designed in Sketch.
