Fitness apps are usually either too cumbersome, requiring manual data entry, or just a fancy todo list. I designed Poosh to motivate you to do one fitness habit with the almost no data entry required.

I designed and developed three separate prototypes of the idea as it evolved with feedback from testers. The prototypes were written in Objective C, and the final version is available in the app store, but no longer maintained.
