Fitness apps are usually either too cumbersome, requiring manual data entry, or just a fancy todo list. I designed Push to motivate you to do one fitness habit with the almost no data entry required.

### Role
I was contracted for 12 months to work on the project. I designed and developed three separate prototypes of the idea as it evolved with feedback from testers. All mockups were made with Sketch. The prototypes were written in Objective C. The app is not yet available.
