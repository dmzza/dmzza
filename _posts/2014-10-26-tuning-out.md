> Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

I have never worked on a software project containing advertisements. This is mostly coincidental, but for my own projects it has always been a thoughtful decision to avoid including advertising. Advertising has always been an annoyance to me, and I didn't see the point in creating something in my free time that I would be annoyed to use. This made sense when my personal projects were only learning experiments in building software. Now I am more interested in building a side business.

Many developers feel conceited towards business people, assuming that it is a trivial matter or that money will follow good code simply by shipping it. I held this conceit for a long time as well until I became interested in the stories of how other people like me became successful. I've taken away some common themes from the most honest accounts. Selling isn't easy. You cannot expect anyone to pay you unless you make a concerted effort to sell your work. Even then, a pitch must convince the reader that they have a painful problem that could be solved by your product for a cost appropriate to eliminate that pain.

For example, I am willing to spend much more with Uber's app than almost any other app I can think of. The amount I am spending is comparable to what I would spend in a cab without Uber, and the experience is so much better that I was willing to change my habits. Spending $0.99 on a consumable in-app purchase in a game is a much more gut-wrenching decision because I have never had a budget for games. Even a dollar put into a game feels like a totally superflous expense for which I only receive a moment of pleasure in the game. Most apps face a similar problem. The problems that many apps solve do not directly correlate with money that people would be spending to deal with that problem already. Therefore, many apps are either venture-backed or include advertising.

If you are solving a problem that requires a network of people to solve, venture capital is the most obvious route to rapid growth. If your app can be used by only one person to solve a problem, then a customer will either have to pay or create revenue for the app in some other way like looking at advertisements. The apps I've built have always been in the latter category, and yet I've never made any money from my customers, because I don't expect them to generate any revenue directly for me.

For a long time I said that I didn't want to earn money from ads, but I also didn't want to be employed full-time. I saw these things as below me, and that those attachments would limit my growth. After years without revenue from side projects or full time employment, I realized that the most significant limit to my growth were these self-imposed pious convictions. By the end of this summer, I had to change course, so I challenged myself to become employed and eat humble pie. So far that has gone relatively well. Now I want to challenge myself to make revenue from a side project.

My goal is to make one dollar in profit by the end of the 2014. Note that I don't count my time as an expense. I also don't think of normal costs of doing business like the Apple Developer annual fee as an expense, because it is necessary to be in my line of work at all. An expense would be something like running ads or paying for a server specifically for a side project.

Tune Out looks like the best candidate to acheive this goal with. It has a super-niche market to start with, and I can only grow it very slowly. It has a monopoly in this market as far as I know. There is no other app that will tell you exactly when to wake up for your stop on the L train in New York City. Likewise for BART if and when I expand to San Francisco.

Initially Tune Out was a paid app for $0.99, but it only sold a handful of times while I was running ads. Further research indicated that the cost-per-install is too high now compared to the lifetime-value of a customer in a paid app to justify advertising as a method of customer acquisition. That leaves me with advertising.
