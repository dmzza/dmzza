> Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

I have never worked on a software project containing advertisements. This is mostly coincidental, but for my own projects it has always been a thoughtful decision to avoid in-app advertising. Advertising has always been an annoyance to me. I didn't see the point in creating something in my free time that I would be annoyed to use. This made sense when my personal projects were only learning experiments in building software. Now I am more interested in building a side business.

Many developers feel that business strategy is below them, assuming that money will follow good code simply by shipping it. I've learned from successful independent developers that it requires a concerted effort. Selling isn't easy. Building up a product along with an audience for it takes a long time. It is very difficult to buy an audience if you intend to sell directly to them. The sales pitch must convince the reader that they have a painful problem that could be solved by your product at a cost appropriate for eliminating that pain.

For example, I am willing to spend more on Spotify every month than any other app. The amount I am spending is less than purchasing music, and the cost is low enough to make pirating seem too time consuming. Spending $0.99 on a consumable in-app purchase in a game is a much more gut-wrenching decision because I have never had a budget for games. Even a dollar put into a game feels like a totally superflous expense for which I only receive a moment of pleasure in the game. Most apps face a similar problem. The exceptionally profitable apps solve a problem in less time or for less money than it used to cost in the old world. The long-tail of apps are either venture-backed or include advertising.

I never wanted to earn money from ads because I wanted to skip over the long-tail of apps right to an exceptionally profitable one. This constraint paralyzed me because the apps that I want to build don't have an obvious business model without advertising. I would prefer to be building an app to gain an audience than to wait around for a better idea.

The worst business model is not having one at all. Using external ads is a weak business model, but it is a start. No business model is permanent. I still need to figure out the potential lifetime value of a customer and where the incentives are under this model.
