> Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

I have never worked on a software project containing advertisements. This is mostly coincidental, but for my own projects it has always been a thoughtful decision to avoid including advertising. Advertising has always been an annoyance to me. I didn't see the point in creating something in my free time that I would be annoyed to use. This made sense when my personal projects were only learning experiments in building software. Now I am more interested in building a side business.

Many developers feel that business strategy is below them, assuming that it is a trivial matter or that money will follow good code simply by shipping it. I held this conceit for a long time as well until I became interested in the stories of how other people built products and brands. I've taken away some common themes from the most honest accounts. Selling isn't easy. Building up a product along with an audience for it takes a long time. It is very difficult to buy an audience if you intend to sell directly to them. You cannot expect anyone to pay you unless you make a concerted effort to sell your work. Even then, a pitch must convince the reader that they have a painful problem that could be solved by your product for a cost appropriate to eliminate that pain.

For example, I am willing to spend more on Spotify every month than any other app. The amount I am spending is less than purchasing music, and the cost is low enough to make pirating seem too time consuming. Spending $0.99 on a consumable in-app purchase in a game is a much more gut-wrenching decision because I have never had a budget for games. Even a dollar put into a game feels like a totally superflous expense for which I only receive a moment of pleasure in the game. Most apps face a similar problem. The most profitable apps solve a problem in less time or for less money than it used to cost in the old world. Therefore, many apps are either venture-backed or include advertising.

For a long time I didn't want to earn money from ads, but I also didn't want to be employed full-time. I thought I was above all that, and that those attachments would constrain me. After years without revenue from side projects or full time employment, I realized that the most significant limit to my growth were these self-imposed pious convictions. By the end of this summer, I had to change course, so I challenged myself to swallow my pride and become employed. (I know, poor me.) Now I want to challenge myself to make revenue from a side project.

My goal is to make one dollar in profit by the end of the 2014. Note that I don't count my time as an expense. I also don't think of normal costs of doing business like the Apple Developer annual fee as an expense, because it is necessary to be in my line of work at all. An expense would be something like running ads or paying for a server specifically for a side project.

Tune Out looks like the best candidate to achieve this goal with. It has a super-niche market to start with, but I can address any market generally, and then launch in a specific market if there is demand. It has a monopoly in this market as far as I know. There is no other app that will tell you exactly when to wake up for your stop on the L train in New York City. Likewise for BART if and when I launch in San Francisco.

Initially Tune Out was a paid app for $0.99, but it only sold a handful of times while I was paying for ads. Further research indicated that the cost-per-install is too high now compared to the lifetime-value of a customer in a paid app to justify advertising as a method of customer acquisition. Instead, I'm going to start blogging about it, with this as the first entry.

I want to align the my incentives to improve the product for customers with the way that it generates revenue. The incentives for a paid up-front app are to create really great screenshots and an app with a solid set of features so that people might recommend it to friends. But there is less incentive to add new features later. Advertising works well because I make money when users open the app. I am incentivized to do anything that will make it easier an more compelling to form a habit of using it. The advertisements aren't distracting from a task either, because the only task is setting the alarm, which is only 2-3 steps. An ad for a game would fit perfectly after you just settled into your commute. If I solve a painful problem for someone, Tune Out will become indispensable for that person until a competitor arrives.

If you happen to live in Brooklyn along the L train, [Tune Out 1.1](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tune-out-l-train-subway-nyc/id644130884?mt=8) is for you. If not, sign up to become a beta tester for the next major release.
