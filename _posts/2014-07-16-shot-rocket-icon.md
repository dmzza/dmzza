Shot Rocket is an app for iPhone photographers who want to find their best shots in the camera roll. I take too many photos to sort through in the Photos app but Adobe Lightroom is overkill, so I'm building something in between.

### Role
I designed this icon in Sketch for my debut shot on Dribbble. I am designed and developing [version 1.0]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-07-01-shot-rocket-1.0 %}) of the app in Objective C.
